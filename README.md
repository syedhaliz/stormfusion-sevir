# StormFusion-SEVIR

A staged, **simple→complex** research framework for precipitation nowcasting and synthetic radar generation on **SEVIR**,
with an engineered path to **new architectures** and **new modalities**.

> **Why this repo?** We want a reproducible scaffold that an AI code agent can extend incrementally—
start with tiny data and a minimal U-Net, then layer losses, temporal modeling, attention/Transformers, GANs,
and eventually multimodal fusion with additional GOES-16 ABI/GLM channels and other sources.

**Key ideas**
- Small-to-large **data regimen** (tiny→subset→full), with gating metrics and unit tests.
- Simple-to-novel **architecture ladder** (persistence/OF baselines → U-Net → ConvLSTM/ConvGRU → attention U-Net →
  Spatiotemporal Transformer (Swin/ViT-like) → diffusion/GAN hybrids).
- **Evaluation you can trust**: forecast metrics (CSI, POD, SUCR, BIAS) and perceptual metrics (LPIPS/SSIM), plus qualitative triplets.
- **Agent-operable instructions** under `docs/AGENT_TASKS/` to auto-generate notebooks per stage.

> This scaffold targets **PyTorch**. It ships with runnable baselines on a tiny split and tests that exercise data, models, and metrics.

## Quick start (local)

```bash
# 1) Create environment (pip)
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: pre-commit for linting
pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install

# 2) Verify install
pytest -q

# 3) Run a smoke train on the tiny split (dummy random tensors or sample HDF5 if present)
python scripts/train.py --config configs/base.yaml --data.tiny=true --max_steps=20

# 4) Evaluate on tiny val
python scripts/evaluate.py --config configs/base.yaml --data.tiny=true
```

## Data (SEVIR)

- This repo expects the **SEVIR catalog** and HDF5 event files to be available locally or via a mounted path. See `data/README.md`.
- Tiny/subset splits are text files with event IDs in `data/samples/`.
- For extended modalities beyond the original SEVIR (more ABI bands, GLM features), see `docs/DATA_ENHANCEMENT.md`.

> Background: SEVIR provides ~10k four-hour events (49 time steps @ 5 min) across ABI C02/C09/C13, VIL radar mosaics, and GLM flashes; images are
aligned on 384 km patches at sensor-native resolutions. This scaffold reuses those conventions and metrics.

## Experiments

- The full staged plan is in `docs/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md` and the **architecture ladder** in `docs/ARCHITECTURE_LADDER.md`.
- Each stage has an agent-readable task file in `docs/AGENT_TASKS/` that will generate or extend notebooks in `notebooks/`.
