# Stage 14 â€” Robustness & uncertainty


**Goal:** Assess sensor gaps, calibration shifts, and predictive uncertainty.

**Agent actions**
1. Train with random sensor dropouts and simulate calibration noise.
2. Evaluate ensembles or MC-dropout for uncertainty; produce reliability diagrams.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Robustness plots + uncertainty calibration analysis documented.
